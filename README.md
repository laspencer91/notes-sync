## What‚Äôs Notes Sync?

Notes Sync is your personal note-taking sidekick, keeping all your notes in a single Markdown file for ultimate simplicity. It:

- **Auto-syncs** your Markdown file to GitHub with every save, preserving file history.
- **Adds AI magic** with daily quotes and smart insights.
- **Offers a unified CLI** for quick note and todo management wherever you are.
- **Keeps things tidy** with automatic formatting and auto-generated daily templates each morning.

Perfect for:

- Daily journals and task tracking in one file.
- Meeting notes synced across devices.
- Any Markdown notes you want backed up effortlessly.
- The service can be installed without the CLI for use in auto-syncing a `.md` git repository.

## üöÄ Get Started in 3 Steps

> üí° **No built-in MD editor**: [Typora](https://typora.io/) is recommended for its beautiful rendering and hot reloading.

1. **Install the CLI**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @notes-sync/cli
   ```

2. **Run the Setup Wizard**:

   ```bash
   notes-sync install
   ```

   This guides you through:
   - Choosing a notes directory (e.g., `~/Documents/DailyNotes`).
   - Picking or creating **one Markdown file** (e.g., `Notes.md`) for all your notes.
   - Setting up a Git repo for syncing.
   - Enabling optional AI features with a Gemini API key.

3. **Test It Out**:

   ```bash
   notes-sync status           # Check service
   notes-sync add -n "First note!"  # Add a note
   notes-sync view --today     # View today‚Äôs notes
   ```

That‚Äôs it! Your single Markdown file is now syncing, and you‚Äôre ready to roll.

## ‚ú® Why You‚Äôll Love It

- **One File, All Notes**: Everything lives in a single Markdown file for simplicity and focus.
- **Auto-Sync to Git**: Saves and pushes your file to GitHub with smart, debounced commits.
- **Daily AI Quotes**: Personalized, motivational quotes based on your notes.
- **Unified CLI**: Interact with your `Notes.md` from wherever you are at with the CLI.
- **Interactive Todos**: Mark complete or delete tasks with simple menus.
- **Smart Search**: Find notes across days within your single file.
- **Auto-Daily Templates**: Fresh daily sections with Focus, Notes, Done, and Tomorrow.
- **Clean Formatting**: Keeps your Markdown file neat and consistent.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Inside?

Notes Sync is split into three npm packages:

- `@notes-sync/cli`: Your go-to CLI for note and todo commands.
- `@notes-sync/service`: Background server and file watcher for auto-sync.
- `@notes-sync/shared`: Shared TypeScript types and API client for smooth communication.

The CLI auto-detects the service, whether in dev or production mode, and guides you if setup is needed.

## üìñ Key Features

## üìã Daily Workflow

notes-sync daily --status    # Check today‚Äôs section
notes-sync add -t "Plan sprint"  # Set goals
```

notes-sync add -n "Discussed API with team"  # Add to your file
notes-sync mark-complete     # Check off tasks
```

**Evening**:

```bash
notes-sync archive           # Clean up completed todos
notes-sync ai query --review # Reflect on progress
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshoot & Uninstall

**Service Issues**:

```bash
notes-sync status  # Check if running
notes-sync logs    # View logs
npm install -g @notes-sync/service  # Reinstall service
```

notes-sync stop
notes-sync-service uninstall
npm uninstall -g @notes-sync/cli @notes-sync/service
rm -rf ~/.config/notes-sync
```

## Limitations

- While a directory of .md files can be synced to git, only one file can be managed by the CLI / Server HTTP.
- No built in UI for Markdown rendering. [Typora](https://typora.io/) is a great option with a clean interface and supports "hot reloading" by default.
- The template format is relatively strict, and not configurable at the time of writing. This would be an awesome feature to have in the future.
